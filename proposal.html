    <h2>"Tour the BMW Zentrum!" - Proposal</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
      I would like to build a website about the BMW “Zentrum” in South Carolina
      ("Zentrum" is German for “museum”). This museum houses pristine examples
      of BMW’s first produced automobiles, featuring some of their most
      impressive engineering feats (including a wacky slide-down door design)!
    </p>

    <h3>
      What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site
      be important?)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The objective of this site is to make visits to the BMW Zentrum possible
      for anyone that has access to a web browser! I happened to be in South
      Carolina for a business trip when I decided to visit the Museum two years
      ago, and I thought to myself, “Wow, I wish I had visited here sooner!”
      However, even as a BMW finatic, if it weren't for my business trip nearby
      I probably wouldn’t have visited the Zentrum for many years. This museum,
      like most other museums, deserves its own dedicated site for users to
      interact with on a larger scale. I would be honored to build such a site!

    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      My target audience for the website is eople who enjoy history,
      engineering, cars (especially BMW enthusiats). Perhaps some BMW forum
      posts announcing the website and/or talking about my experience visiting
      there could help in reaching this target audience directly.

    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      I plan to show photos of the scenic walk into the museum on the home page,
      and a “begin your tour” button over these image(s). I also plan to have an
      “about” page to provide some background about the museum. The “begin your
      tour” button on the home screen will direct the viewer to the “about”
      page, and a “next” button will direct the viewer to the first of several
      car overview pages: one page dedicated to each car on display in the
      museum. I plan to include multiple photos of each car, accompanied with a
      placard description of the cars and perhaps my observations after seeing
      the car in person. Fascinatingly, the only United States based BMW factory
      is located on the same property as the museum. And just across the street
      is BMW’s performance driving school! Without a doubt, there is a lot of
      content to share with others, and I’m excited to have the opportunity to
      do so through a website!
